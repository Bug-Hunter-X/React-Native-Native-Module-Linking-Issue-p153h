This error occurs when you are using a library that depends on a native module, and the native module is not correctly linked or configured for your platform (Android or iOS).  This often happens when you've installed a library using npm or yarn, but haven't completed the required native setup steps.  The error messages might not always point directly to the problem, often showing general linkage errors or build failures.
