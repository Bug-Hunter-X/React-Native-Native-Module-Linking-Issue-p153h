The solution to this problem involves carefully checking the platform-specific configuration files (Android's `android/app/build.gradle`, `android/settings.gradle` and iOS's `ios/Podfile`) to ensure the native module is properly linked.  This typically involves adding dependencies, linking libraries, and potentially modifying build settings.  Consult the documentation for your specific native module to ensure you complete all necessary steps. 

For instance, if using a module `react-native-mymodule` you would ensure:
* The necessary files for android (`*.aar`) and ios (`*.podspec`) are included in the correct location
* The ios `Podfile` has the module listed (add it if not)
* The android gradle files have the dependency included.

This might involve manually running gradle tasks (for android) or pod install (for ios) to ensure the modules are correctly built and integrated into the React Native application. Pay close attention to error messages during the build process, as these (if present) often hold critical hints on the exact problem.
Sometimes, cleaning the build folder or even a fresh clone and reinstall might be needed.
