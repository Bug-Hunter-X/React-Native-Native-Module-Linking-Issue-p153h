# React Native Native Module Linking Issue

This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose issue in React Native:  linking errors with native modules.  The error messages are frequently unhelpful, making troubleshooting challenging.

The example shows a scenario where a native module (hypothetical) is not properly linked, leading to build failures or runtime errors. The solution demonstrates the typical steps involved in resolving such issues.  This includes checking Android and iOS build configurations to ensure the module is correctly integrated.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Attempt to build and run the app (expect errors initially).
5. Follow the steps in the `RNLinkingSolution.js` file to resolve the linking issues.
